tomato_bacterial_spot,"Bacterial spot on tomatoes is a disease caused by Xanthomonas bacteria, resulting in dark, angular spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. These spots can be small and numerous, appearing water-soaked initially, then turning black and slightly raised. Severe infections can lead to defoliation, stunted growth, and even plant death, particularly in warm, wet, and windy conditions",Blue Shield® DF Copper Fungicide; Serenade® Opti,https://www.crop.bayer.com.au/products/fungicides/blue-shield-copper-fungicide#tab-1; https://www.crop.bayer.com.au/products/bayer-biologics/serenade-opti
tomato_early_blight,"Early blight on tomato plants is a common fungal disease characterized by dark, circular spots with concentric rings, resembling a ""target"" pattern on leaves, stems, and fruit. These spots can also be surrounded by a yellow halo, and affected leaves may eventually wither and drop. The disease thrives in warm, humid conditions and can significantly impact yield if left unchecked",AMISTAR Top; Antracol® Fungicide Spray,https://www.syngenta.com.au/products/fungicides/amistar-top; https://www.crop.bayer.com.au/products/fungicides/antracol-fungicide-spray
tomato_late_blight,"Tomato late blight, caused by the water mold Phytophthora infestans, is a devastating disease that can quickly destroy tomato crops. It manifests as dark, irregular lesions on leaves and stems, and brown, firm spots on the fruit. White, fuzzy fungal growth may also be visible on the underside of leaves in humid conditions. The disease thrives in cool, moist environments, and can spread rapidly, leading to significant yield losses",ZINEB; Fontelis,https://www.nutrienhorticulture.com.au/product/zineb; https://www.corteva.com.au/products-and-solutions/crop-protection/fontelis.html
tomato_mosaic_virus,"Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) is a plant virus that primarily affects tomato plants, causing mosaic patterns on leaves, stunted growth, and deformed or mottled fruit. It's a common and economically damaging virus, particularly in greenhouse and outdoor tomato crops","No chemical available. Recommended management practices. Infected plants should be removed and destroyed to prevent further spread. Disinfecting tools and equipment is important to minimize transmission. Inspecting transplants for signs of infection before planting can help prevent introduction of the virus. Controlling aphids and thrips can also help, as they can spread the virus",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_mosaic_virus
tomato_two_spotted_spider_mite,"Two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) are tiny pests, often less than 0.5mm long, that can be found on tomatoes. They are typically yellowish-green with two dark spots (though some may be reddish). These mites feed on plant cells, causing stippling, yellowing, or bronzing of leaves, and can even lead to leaf drop and plant death in severe infestations. They also produce webbing on plants, especially under leaves",BIOPEST; VERTIMEC Pro,https://tgrm.com.au/_products//Products/FARMCHEMICALS/BIOPESTPARAFFINOIL205LTWHITEOILSACOA545903-8105-20978-.aspx; https://www.syngenta.com.au/products/insecticides/vertimec-pro
tomato_yellow_leaf_curl_virus,"Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a devastating disease complex affecting tomato plants, particularly in tropical and warm temperate regions, leading to significant yield losses. The virus is characterized by stunted growth, reduced leaf size, upward curling and yellowing of leaves, and flower drop. It is transmitted by the silverleaf whitefly",No chemical available. Recommended management practices. Controlling the whitefly population is crucial for managing TYLCV. Using tomato varieties with resistance or tolerance to TYLCV is an important strategy.,https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/plant-diseases/vegetable-diseases/tomato-yellow-leaf-curl-virus
